""" 
Implementation of the two-wheeled differential drive robot car 
and its controller.
 
Our goal in using LQR is to find the optimal control inputs:
  [linear velocity of the car, angular velocity of the car]
     
We want to both minimize the error between the current state 
and a desired state, while minimizing actuator effort 
(e.g. wheel rotation rate). These are competing objectives because a 
large u (i.e. wheel rotation rates) expends a lot of
actuator energy but can drive the state error to 0 really fast.
LQR helps us balance these competing objectives.
 
If a system is linear, LQR gives the optimal control inputs that 
takes a system's state to 0, where the state is
"current state - desired state".
